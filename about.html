          <h3>[Raghav Sharma]</h3>
          <p>
            I’m a student web developer passionate about combining technology and creativity.
            GameMatch was built as part of a major semester project, incorporating responsive design, dynamic JavaScript quizzes, and multimedia content.
          </p>
          <p>
            My biggest challenge was ensuring the quiz accurately recommends games and that each page flows visually. I learned advanced HTML, CSS, and JS techniques while building this project — from parallax scrolling to responsive grids and embedded media.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        This project helped me understand how design, function, and usability come together in web development.
        I learned how to structure a full website from scratch — balancing creativity, coding, and presentation.
        GameMatch is not just a website — it’s a demonstration of growth, learning, and passion for digital design.
